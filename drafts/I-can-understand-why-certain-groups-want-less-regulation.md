Thinking about how older buildings were built with less regulation. 

- Everyone was good at their craft
- I imagine an inspector came, but someone would explain how things were built. I think there must have been good relationships between the inspectors and the builders. There must have been some kind of rappor where they trusted each other. 

- Made me also think about AI, and what kind of jobs it will replace. AI will not be able to recreate that inherit trust bond so quickly. It just wont be possible. You need to offer your own experiences and explainations unpromted, but these are also explanations/experiences you know the other side can relate to.
