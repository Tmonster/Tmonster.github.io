basically the title

they already rexognize it as a threat, they can protect against in a bith foreign and domestic way.

then maybe, just maybe, mandatory milotary service can also mean environemntal protections 

Idea:

The U.S military should be in charge of "Defending Against Climate Change". They already have recognized it as a threat to America (source?). The Department of Defense also has the largest budget of any department in Federal Government. It has also been reported that they consistently have more money than they know what to do with.

Reasons:

1. Largest budget of all departments, means there are no monetary issues around research/development etc.
2. The Department of defense already realizes that Climate Change is a problem.
3. Potentially more people serving in the military if they could choose to work on Environmental causes and only report to active duty if the U.S declares itself in a state of war (which also hasn't happened since ???). This will also make the military base more diverse.
4. The military is also potentially more organized than a department of Energy would be.
5. Also could inform active military members (some of which don't believe in climate change), and passive military members.
