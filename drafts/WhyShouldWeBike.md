Biking in Amsterdam



Pros:
1. It is an extremely efficient people mover when you consider space, maintenance, and health of a city
2. The infrastructure is cheap
3. The Density of how many people can be moved is astronomically higher than cars
4. Less accidents, people learn to be aware of their surroundings and take responsibility
5. Better for the environment. 
- Think noise pollution & body health & C02 emissions
5. 


Take this image of myself at a traffic light on a shared road. I can count 25 bicycles waiting. Let's now look at this street on google maps. From my picture, I can see that I am about at position X, conservatively speaking, that much space can handle 25 people on bikes. Now lets try to convert that to cars. 

Converting it to cars means that the line of cars will go almost back to the bridge. 




Side note. 
- I'm not addvocating to get rid of cars. I love cars, and I think there will always be a use case for cars. Cars are useful for family trips to remote places that public transit can not get you to efficiently. My point is that within a dense city, cars are the enemy to sustainable growth.
