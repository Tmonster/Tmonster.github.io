Biking in Amsterdam


It is one of the best people movers. 


1. The infrastructure can be cheaper than highways
2. The Density of how many people can be moved is astronomically higher than cars
3. Less accidents
4. Better for the environment. 
- Think noise pollution & body health & C02 emissions
5. 


Take this image of myself at a traffic light on a shared road. I can count 25 bicycles waiting. Let's now look at this street on google maps. From my picture, I can see that I am about at position X, conservatively speaking, that much space can handle 25 people on bikes. Now lets try to convert that to cars. 

Converting it to cars means that the line of cars will go almost back to the bridge. 




Side note. 
- I'm not addvocating to get rid of cars. I love cars, and I think cars will never go away. Cars are useful for family trips to remote places that public transit can not get you to efficiently.
