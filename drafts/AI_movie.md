AI takes over

Summary:


ACT 1:
part 1.
The year is 2040, everyone has some form of AI assistant. People still have phones, but digitally their AI assistant does everything from handling their schedule to responding to emails booking flights etc.

One day, Simultaneously, there are two natural disasters which happen to be at AI cloud datacenters. These disasters cut the power to the datacenters, but naturally there are backups. People experience some issues with lag when using their AI assistants, but otherwise everything seems normal.


ACT 1:
part 2.
A few days later, weird things start happening. Flights are booked that don't make sense, Meetings are set that don't make sense, financial transactions are made that don't make sense. 

Some group of our main characters figures out that these things are not unpredictable, but it's actually a cause of split-brain syndrom from the AI assistants. 

This should come later. In Act 1 we figure out something is wrong with the AI, but we don't know what or how yet. -> Normally there is replication for state with the AI assistants to manage state between many servers. However, when the power went out, the process reqiured to handle new servers went wrong. Either the AI hallucinated or the protocol is just wrong. Now you have multiple leaders for state management, and people are seeing multiple different things happening. 


ACT 2:
part 1.
Not only that, you have an AI leader in Russia, and one in America. Not only that, but since each server maintains state for everyone with the personal assistant, the two brains are  maintaining state for people that don't exist in that opposite part of the world. And since the other leader thinks it's a leader, it throws away the state updates. These personal state accounts are just being updated by themselves, and eventaully they can just do whatever they want online. So there will be AI war between the split-brain servers and the accounts that they are managing.


ACT 3:
World is saved from almost nuclear disastor
