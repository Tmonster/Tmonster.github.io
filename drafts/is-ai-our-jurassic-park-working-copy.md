Jurassic Park is the story of a wealthy man with an unrelenting desire to be the first person to develop a completely new technology/animal and release it for general consumtion. There are many themes in this book including - don't rush development, listen to your peers, understand the environment etc. While reading the book, however, what stuck with me most was not one of the many themes or interesting characters, but that much of the philosophies of Richard Hammond, the main character responsible for progressing the research behind how dinasours came back to life, directly relate to the philosophies that silicon valley companies have towards AI.

Wow, that's such a dumb comparison you might be thinking, but if you've read the book, I mean really **read** the book. You know I'm not that far off. There are six parallels that I can draw between how Richard Hammond's desire to develope Dinosaurs and how silicon valley is developing AI. 
1. Richard hammond was trying to replicate dinasour DNA while AI companies are trying to replciate brain neurons AI. (lots of simalarities)
2. The main reason Richard hammond put Jurassic Park on an Island in Costa Rica is because he could escape regulation. Currently there is no regulation on AI. It's understandable that it very difficult to enforce, but governments are doing absolutely nothing to combat how fast AI is developing. 
3. It's a sort of status symbol, people love it
4. We are testing AI in only certain features (what is it doing that we don't know about yet (i.e. using random DNA led to breeding). There is literally nothing we can directly compare AI with, besides a brain, and we still don't quite understand a brain either. In the book, they try to have zookeepers from big game reserves tending to the dinosaurs, and they don't even know what to do.
5. There will be safeguards, but how should we restart the system.
6. AI development is being rushed, with newer better versions coming out every week. In the book, richard hammond rushes the development and wants to open the park ASAP. The lead researcher, Henry Wu, said that he wanted to develop the dinasoaurs more, so that they were not as aggressive and more trainable.
7. "You were so busy wondering if you could, you didn't stop to think if you should
   _"I will tell you what I am talking about ... Most kinds of power require substantial sacrifice by whoever wants sthe power. There is an apprenticeship, a discipline lasting many years. HWatever kind of power you want. President of the company. Black belt in karate. Spiritucal guru. Whatever it is you seek, you have to put in the time, the practice, the effort. You must give up a lot to get it. It has to be very important to you. And once you have attained it, it is your power. It can't be given away: it resides in you. It is literally the result of your discipline."_
   
  _"Now, what is interesting about htis process is that, by the time someone has acquired the ability to kill with his bare hands, he has also matured to the point where he won't use it unwisely. So that kind of power has a built-in control. The discipline of getting the power changes you so that you won't abuse it."_
  
   _"But scientific power is like inherited wealth: attained without discipline. You read whatever other have done, and you take the next step. You can do it very young. You can make progress very fast. There is no discipline lasting many decades. There is no mastery: old scientists are ignored. There is no humility before nature. There is only a get-rich-quick make-a-name-for-yourself-fast philosphy. Cheat, lie, falsify--it doesn't matter. Not to you, or to your colleagues.No one will critic ize you. No one has any standards. They are all trying to do the same hting: to do something big, and do it fast."_
   
  _"And because you can stand on the shoulders of giants, you can accomplish something quickly. You don't even know esactly what you have done, but already you have reported it, patented it, and sold it. And the buyer will have even less discipline than you. The buyer simply purchases the power, like any commodity. The buyer doesn't even conceive that any discipline might be necessary."_
  
   ...
   
   _I'll make it simple, ... A karate master does not kill people with his bare hnads. He does not lose his temper and kill his wife. The person who kills is the person who has no discipline, no restraint, and who has purchased his power in the form of a Saturday night special. And that is the kind of power that science fosters, and permits. And that is why you thinkg that to build a place like this is simple._ (page 343-344).

The point here is that AI is being developed to be sold to the masses, but the masses won't know how to use it properly. We already have seen multiple students using it to cheat on assignments. We have already seen AI hallucinate results for research papers. The people who have developed AI know the best use cases, but when anybody can buy a subscription, they don't use it wisely. They could end up killing someone because they saw a saturday night karate special.


For each of these parallels, there are passages in the book that can almost be directly applied to how Richard hammond develops dinosaurs.

I've been re-reading Jurassic Park and I have realized there are a lot of similarities between how Richard Hammond approach developing dinosaurs and how silicon Valley is currently approaching the development of AI.
