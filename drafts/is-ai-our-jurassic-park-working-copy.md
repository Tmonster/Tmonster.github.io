Jurassic Park is the story of a wealthy man with an unrelenting desire to be the first person to develop a completely new technology/animal and release it for general consumtion. There are many themes in this book including - don't rush development, listen to your peers, understand the environment etc. While reading the book, however, what stuck with me most was not one of the many themes or interesting characters, but that much of the philosophies of Richard Hammond, the main character responsible for progressing the research behind how dinasours came back to life, directly relate to the philosophies that silicon valley companies have towards AI.

Wow, that's such a dumb comparison you might be thinking, but if you've read the book, I mean really **read** the book. You know I'm not that far off.

I've been re-reading Jurassic Park and I have realized there are a lot of similarities between how Richard Hammond approach developing dinosaurs and how silicon Valley is currently approaching the development of AI.
