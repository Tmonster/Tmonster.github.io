Jurassic Park is the story of a wealthy man with an unrelenting desire to be the first person to develop a completely new technology/animal and release it for general consumtion. There are many themes in this book including - don't rush development, listen to your peers, understand the environment etc. While reading the book, however, what stuck with me most was not one of the many themes or interesting characters, but that much of the philosophies of Richard Hammond, the main character responsible for progressing the research behind how dinasours came back to life, directly relate to the philosophies that silicon valley companies have towards AI.

Wow, that's such a dumb comparison you might be thinking, but if you've read the book, I mean really **read** the book. You know I'm not that far off. There are six parallels that I can draw between how Richard Hammond's desire to develope Dinosaurs and how silicon valley is developing AI. 
1. Richard hammond was trying to replicate dinasour DNA while AI companies are trying to replciate brain neurons AI. (lots of simalarities)
2. The main reason Richard hammond put Jurassic Park on an Island in Costa Rica is because he could escape regulation. Currently there is no regulation on AI. It's understandable that it very difficult to enforce, but governments are doing absolutely nothing to combat how fast AI is developing. 
3. It's a sort of status symbol, people love it
4. We are testing AI in only certain features (what is it doing that we don't know about yet (i.e. using random DNA led to breeding). There is literally nothing we can directly compare AI with, besides a brain, and we still don't quite understand a brain either. In the book, they try to have zookeepers from big game reserves tending to the dinosaurs, and they don't even know what to do.
5. There will be safeguards, but how should we restart the system.
6. AI development is being rushed, with newer better versions coming out every week. In the book, richard hammond rushes the development and wants to open the park ASAP. The lead researcher, Henry Wu, said that he wanted to develop the dinasoaurs more, so that they were not as aggressive and more trainable.

For each of these parallels, there are passages in the book that can almost be directly applied to how Richard hammond develops dinosaurs.

I've been re-reading Jurassic Park and I have realized there are a lot of similarities between how Richard Hammond approach developing dinosaurs and how silicon Valley is currently approaching the development of AI.
