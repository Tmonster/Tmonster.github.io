This month I want to try and use my iphone under the accessiblity settings for poor sighted people. This will mean my text will go from images of X to Y. 

### Why?

Honestly I don't know, with the new year and everything, it might just be nice to change things up. Also, I have some family members and family friends who use this feature, and I want to know what it feels like. I understand of course that I am not someone with poor eye-sight, but nonetheless, I think it will be nice to try this for a month.
