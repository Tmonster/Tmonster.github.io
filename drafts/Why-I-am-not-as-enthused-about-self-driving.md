I've seen many articles about self-driving cars getting the go-ahead to expand in cities/regions like [San Francisco](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40789411) and [Los Angeles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39567597). These announcements have been met with mostly positive reactions from the public because self-driving cars are safer than human drivers, and prevent stress created from driving. My worry, however, is that these benefits will not be as widespread as advertised. While the safety benefits are clear, adoption will be **very** slow, and the overall cost (money, time, freedom) to be transported from A to B will not change drastically. This will mean that self driving cars only have a safety benfit (if that) with little to no societal or monetary benefits.

 <!-- Most likely, self-driving sill never be available in every car, and every car will not have the same self-driving version/product, making communication between self-driving cars a problem that will take another 10-20 years to -->

To demonstrate this, let us suppose that self driving cars & taxis are legal tomorrow and self driving taxi companies have the infrastructure to accomodate 50% of all the active cars on the road. Here are my thoughts on what will happen after 3 months, 6 months, a year, 5 years, and 10 years.


3 months.
About 20% of people who commute to work in a car are using self-driving cars. The rest of the commuters are still hesitant of the technology or find it cheaper to drive themselves. There is still rush-hour traffic since not enough self-driving cars are on the road. The number of drunk driving accidents is lower, by about 20%. The freight industry is looking into how they can install self-driving technologies on their trucks.


6 months. 
35% of daily commuters are commuting with a self-driving option. For other workers, it is still cheaper to drive their own cars. This imbalance results in the continued existence of rush-hour traffic. The number of accidents related to fatigue and drunk driving is 40% lower than before self-driving. Self driving cars are disabled on days with low-visibility & rain because their behaviour is too unpredictable and has caused a number of accidents or problems during rush-hour traffic. Most self-driving cars are still only electric, so the public has range anxiety about using self-driving cars for road trips. In addition, there have been more cases of self-driving cars that cannot handle extreme random road situations like poorly marked detours due to construction or making way for emergency vehicles in tight road situations.

1 year:
Within the year 50% of all daily commuters are using self-driving cars. There is still traffic during rush hour. Self-driving cars still cannot handle rainy or low-visibility days. 

5 years:
Self-driving companies have scaled up their infrastructure so 75% of cars on the road during rush hour are self driving. There is still a ban on self-driving cars during rainy days and low-visibility days, although the number of days where the ban takes effect is less than 20 days a year. With 25% of cars on the road during rush hour still being self-driving cars, there is still traffic, so your commutes are only 10% faster. The number of different destinations of self-driving cars within a downtown make self-driving cars are suboptimial. Every once in a while the news has a story that all traffic mustÂ be self-driving to get rid of traffic.

10 year:
TODO: basically every car can install self-driving for a price. New cars are specifically manufactured for a more social trip. However, some people still enjoy offroading, so they still own their own cars. Product life for batteries of self-driving cars are seriously being questions. Kids are going to school in self-driving cars, but there are reports of children abduction because no one really pays attention to the road in a self-driving vehicle.

The benefits of self-driving have not improved over the last 5 years. Some people still own some type of vehicle that they can drive themselves to feel some kind of freedom. The auto industry has promised to only make cars with self-driving capabilities because of their popularity. The number of fatigue induced or drunk driving related accidents is effectively 0. There are still cars on the road, causing noise pollution, many errands are reduced to ordering from a store (i.e walmart) and having a self-driving vehicle drop off the products. This has led to many self-driving cars being broken into, raising other questions about safety.

Many kids in suburban areas go to school without their parents in a self-driving car. They see only a car seat in front of them, or they are looking at some new Iphone 25. They have no sense of their environment or what roads they need to take to get to school. All new infrastructure that is built is designed with self-driving cars in mind, how and where to park self-driving vehicles, identifiable markers for self driving car cameras. 


I hope in sharing this thought experiment, people can realize that self-driving cars will not fix that much. Rush hour traffic will still be a problem, and the general public, while initially pleased with self-driving cars, will still feel the effects of isolation, loneliness, and cost that comes form requiring a car to go anywhere. 

Self-driving cars will make driving safer, and I will not argue that point here. What I will argue, however, -- at the risk of sounding like someone who think abstinence means "safe sex" -- is that if less people are driving, then overall, driving is safer. Yes, this is a blog post about urban planning. Self-driving cars will not get cars off the road, so rush hour will still exist. People will still need to open an app on their phone to go anywhere. Eventually, the general public will get tired of this and want independence from self-driving cars back, and buy a car they can drive themselves again. 

I love self-driving cars, but I don't want to loose sight of a bigger goal which is better urbanization. We need denser cities with more public trainsportation options. I lived in San Francisco, a pretty urban city, and at times, I still felt isolated because only 3 busses served my neighborhood, and they were infrequent and unreliable. 

Self driving will not solve traffic, nor  will it solve the innefeciency of every family owning multiple cars. 


I hope to release a blog post about how a denser city & better public transit & better bike infrastructure can help solve these problems in a much cleaner way.

<!-- 
While self-driving cars will make driving safer, it won't take cars off of the road. So while the roads are safer, they are still congested. You can argue that driving in traffic is frustrating, but don't forget the saying:

'You aren't stuck in traffic, you *are* traffic'

Basically, if every person in a car in rush our traffic is now driving a self-driving car, I don't think traffic will suddenly disappear. Yes, all cars in a line can accelerate and cars will manage lane changes much better, but that technology is still far away. 

Also, suppose tomorrow


Benefits
1. It's safer, I won't deny that.
   - Less drunk drivers
   - Less tired drivers
   - More predictable drivers that can talk to each other.

1. It doesn't take cars off the road (in fact, it might add more cars).
   - People won't sell their combustion cars, can't recoupe investment, or they want to keep it for longer drives
   - chances are, for those who use their car a lot, driving their own car is still cheaper.
   - People will use waymo for commuting,
   - This means congestion isn't solved.
2. Waymo cars are still easily tricked

3. We are in danger of privatizing transport
4. The debate of who is at fault for collisions will never be solved.

5. This one is just for me
   - All parents will complain and say they can't/won't trust or understand it, but ultimately admit it's nice to have. This discourse will eventually become extremely tiresome.  -->
