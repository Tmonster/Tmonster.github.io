I've seen many articles about self-driving cars getting the go-ahead to expand in cities/regions like San Francisco and Austin. These announcements are usually met with positive reactions from the public. It is hard to debate the fact that self-driving cars are generally safer than human drivers under the right conditions. What I don't understand however, is how much of a positive societal impact self driving cars will have. 


Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that self driving cars are legal everywhere tomorrow and self driving taxi companies have the infrastructure to accomodate 50% of all the active cars on the road. Here are my thoughts on what will happen on day 0, in 3 months, in 6 months, a year later, 5 years later, and 10 years later.

Day 0.
Not much will change, some beta testers of self-driving cars are happy to use self-driving cars, but it will take a while before there is still a lot of adoption.

3 months.
About 20% of people who commute to work in a car are using self-driving cars. The rest of the commuters are still hesitant of the technology or find it cheaper to drive themselves. There is still rush-hour traffic since not enough self-driving cars are on the road. The number of drunk driving accidents is lower, but only by about 20%


6 months. 
More adoption for daily commuters, let's say 35%. Again, for certain workers, it's just cheaper to drive their own cars. There is still rush-hour traffic. The number of accidents related to fatigue and drunk driving is 40% lower than before self-driving. Self driving cars are disabled on days with low-visibility & rain. Their behaviour is too unpredictable and has caused a number of accidents or problems during rush-hour traffic. Most self-driving cars are also only electric, so the public has range anxiety about using self-driving cars for road trips.

1 year:
Finally we hit 50% adoption for daily commuters. There is still traffic during rush hour. These cars still cannot handle rainy or low-visibility days. 

5 years:
Self-driving companies have scaled up their infrastructure so 75% of cars on the road during rush hour are self driving. There is still a ban on self-driving cars during rainy days and low-visibility days, although the number of days where the ban takes effect is less than 20 days a year. With 75% of cars on the road during rush hour being self-driving cars, there is still traffic. Your commute is faster, but the 25% of cars that are not self driving, and the number of different destinations within a downtown mean that self-driving cars are suboptimial. 

10 year:
The benefits of self-driving have not improved over the last 5 years. Some people still own some type of vehicle that they can drive themselves to feel some kind of freedom. There are not many new consumer cars that can be bought because most people enjoy self-driving cars. The number of fatigue induced or drunk driving related accidents is practically 0. There are still cars on the road, causing noise pollution, and people still need a car to do many basic tasks like get milk.
Kids are going to school without their parents in a self-driving car, seeing only a seat in front of them and none of the environment around them. All new infrastructure that is being built is being built so that it is easier to move self driving cars in and out of a parking lot. 


I hope in sharing this thought experiment, people can realize that self-driving cars will not fix that much. Rush hour traffic will still be a problem, and the general public, while initially pleased with self-driving cars, will still feel the effects of isolation and loneliness that comes form requiring a car to go anywhere. 

Self-driving cars will make driving safer, and I will not argue that point here. What I will argue, however, -- at the risk of sounding like someone who think abstinence means "safe sex" -- is that if less people are driving, then overall, driving is safer. Yes, this is a blog post about urban planning. Self-driving cars will not get cars off the road, so rush hour will still exist. People will still need to open an app on their phone to go anywhere. Eventually, the general public will get tired of this and want independence from self-driving cars back, and buy a car they can drive themselves again. 

I love self-driving cars, but I don't want to loose sight of a bigger goal which is better urbanization. We need denser cities with more public trainsportation options. I lived in San Francisco, a pretty urban city, and at times, I still felt isolated because only 3 busses served my neighborhood, and they were infrequent and unreliable. 

Self driving will not solve traffic, nor  will it solve the innefeciency of every family owning multiple cars. 


I hope to release a blog post about how a denser city & better public transit & better bike infrastructure can help solve these problems in a much cleaner way.

<!-- 
While self-driving cars will make driving safer, it won't take cars off of the road. So while the roads are safer, they are still congested. You can argue that driving in traffic is frustrating, but don't forget the saying:

'You aren't stuck in traffic, you *are* traffic'

Basically, if every person in a car in rush our traffic is now driving a self-driving car, I don't think traffic will suddenly disappear. Yes, all cars in a line can accelerate and cars will manage lane changes much better, but that technology is still far away. 

Also, suppose tomorrow


Benefits
1. It's safer, I won't deny that.
   - Less drunk drivers
   - Less tired drivers
   - More predictable drivers that can talk to each other.

1. It doesn't take cars off the road (in fact, it might add more cars).
   - People won't sell their combustion cars, can't recoupe investment, or they want to keep it for longer drives
   - chances are, for those who use their car a lot, driving their own car is still cheaper.
   - People will use waymo for commuting,
   - This means congestion isn't solved.
2. Waymo cars are still easily tricked

3. We are in danger of privatizing transport
4. The debate of who is at fault for collisions will never be solved.

5. This one is just for me
   - All parents will complain and say they can't/won't trust or understand it, but ultimately admit it's nice to have. This discourse will eventually become extremely tiresome.  -->
