Benefits
1. It's safer, I won't deny that.
   - Less drunk drivers
   - Less tired drivers
   - More predictable drivers that can talk to each other.

1. It doesn't take cars off the road (in fact, it might add more cars).
   - People won't sell their combustion cars, can't recoupe investment, or they want to keep it for longer drives
   - chances are, for those who use their car a lot, driving their own car is still cheaper.
   - People will use waymo for commuting,
   - This means congestion isn't solved.
2. Waymo cars are still easily tricked

3. We are in danger of privatizing transport
4. The debate of who is at fault for collisions will never be solved.

5. This one is just for me
   - All parents will complain and say they can't/won't trust or understand it, but ultimately admit it's nice to have. This discourse will eventually become extremely tiresome.
