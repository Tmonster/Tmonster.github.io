My name is Tom Ebergen. I was born in Kitchener Ontario, and I moved to San Francisco when I was two and a half. After high school, I pursued a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a minor in Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. After graduating, I moved back to San Francisco and started working at [Alation](https://www.alation.com/). After two years at Alation I decided to move to Amsterdam to pursue a Masters degree in Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems.

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, ultimate frisbee, and golfing, and socializing with friends. I currently work at DuckDB Labs improving the optimizer for DuckDB.
