title: About me
---

My name is Tom Ebergen. I was born in Kitchener Ontario, and I moved to San Francisco when I was two and a half. After high school, I pursued a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a minor in Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. After graduating, I moved back to San Francisco and started working at [Alation](https://www.alation.com/). After two years at Alation I moved to Amsterdam to pursue a Masters degree in Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems. 

For my Masters thesis I researched Join Order Optimization and implemented a new join order optimizer for DuckDB. My thesis can be found [here](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/msc/2022-TomEbergen.pdf), or in my [docs](https://github.com/tmonster/docs/TomEbergenMasterThesis.pdf). After my masters thesis I started to work at DuckDBLabs full time. My work at DuckDB labs  includes working on the optimizer and managing the db-benchmark.

In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, ultimate frisbee, and golfing, and socializing with friends.
